# Trapizoidal-method-Integration-
Trapezoidal Rule is a rule that evaluates the area under the curves by dividing the total area into smaller trapezoids rather than using rectangles. This integration works by approximating the region under the graph of a function as a trapezoid, and it calculates the area.
